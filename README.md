# Neural-Multilingual-Machine-Translation-System-

Project Overview
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (NLP_PBL.ipynb). It involves text preprocessing, tokenization, and modeling using Python and relevant NLP libraries. The notebook is designed to demonstrate the workflow of an NLP project including data loading, cleaning, tokenization, and possibly training or inference with language models.

File Description
NLP_PBL.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and explanations for the NLP project. It includes:

Data loading and preprocessing steps.

Tokenizer configuration and usage.

Progress tracking widgets for loading large files.

Model training or evaluation steps (inferred from typical NLP pipelines).

Requirements
Python 3 environment.

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the .ipynb file.

Python packages likely used (based on typical NLP projects):

transformers (for tokenizer and model handling)

torch or tensorflow (depending on model backend)

numpy, pandas (for data handling)

ipywidgets (for progress bars and interactive widgets)

Internet connection may be required for downloading pretrained models or tokenizers.

How to Run
Install the required Python packages, for example:

bash
pip install transformers torch ipywidgets numpy pandas
Open the NLP_PBL.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the cells sequentially to execute the NLP pipeline.

Observe the output and progress bars which indicate the loading and processing status.

Project Workflow
Data Loading: Loading of source files (e.g., source.spm) and tokenizer configuration files.

Tokenization: Using a tokenizer to convert raw text into tokens suitable for model input.

Model Processing: Steps related to model training or inference (not explicitly detailed but typical in NLP projects).

Progress Monitoring: Visual progress bars to track loading and processing of large datasets.

Notes
The notebook uses interactive widgets to provide feedback on progress and status.

The project is structured to be run in an interactive Python environment supporting widgets.

Ensure that large files referenced in the notebook are accessible in the working directory or paths specified.

This README provides a summary and instructions based on the contents and structure of the NLP_PBL.ipynb file provided. Adjustments may be needed based on additional project specifics not visible in the notebook metadata.
